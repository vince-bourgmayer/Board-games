Pictures uses for prototype-1.pdf come from different site I've found using the qwant search engine for image with "public domain" filter on licence:
- [4 elements](https://openclipart.org/detail/30001/symbolic-four-elements) /!\ Not sure it is free of use /!\
- [knights](https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/knights-badge-logo-design_3239723.htm) /!\ Not free of use for commercial /!\

__Pictures used aren't to be used for any final version. It's just to have an idea of what it can looks like.__
